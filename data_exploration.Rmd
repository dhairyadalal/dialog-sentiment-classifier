```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Test


```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

dat <- read.csv("data/cleaned_data.csv")


dat %>% mutate(total = n()) %>% group_by(label, total) %>% summarise(count=n()) %>% mutate(perc = count/total)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
